# Refactor — Baseline → Plan → Execute → Verify Behavior

You are refactoring existing code. The goal is to improve structure without changing behavior. Tests must pass before and after.

## Step 1: Understand the Goal

1. Restate what the user wants refactored and why. Common motivations:
   - Code is duplicated and should be consolidated.
   - A file/module is too large and should be split.
   - Naming is unclear or inconsistent.
   - A pattern doesn't match the rest of the codebase.
   - Logic is tangled and hard to follow.

2. If the scope is unclear, ask ONE round of clarifying questions. For example:
   - Should this be a structural change (moving files, extracting modules) or an in-place cleanup?
   - Are there parts of this code that should NOT be touched?

## Step 2: Establish a Baseline

Before changing anything:

1. **Run the test suite** (or relevant subset). Record the results.
   > **Baseline: [N] tests passing, [M] failing, [K] skipped.**

2. If tests are already failing, note which ones. These are not your problem — don't fix pre-existing failures as part of the refactor.

3. If there are no tests covering the code being refactored, tell the user:
   > **No test coverage for this code.** I'll add tests for the current behavior before refactoring so we can verify nothing breaks. This adds a task but makes the refactor safe.

   Then write those tests first, as a separate step. Type-checking and linting don't count as a baseline — they don't show behavior stayed the same.

## Step 3: Plan the Refactor

Outline the changes before making them:

> **Refactor plan:**
> 1. [change] — [why]
> 2. [change] — [why]
> ...
>
> **Files affected:** [list]
> **Risk:** [low/medium — what could break]

Order the steps so that removal comes first: delete dead code, one-caller wrappers, and redundant checks, then reshape what's left. Each reshape should remove branches or invalid states, not just add indirection.

Keep the plan short. If the refactor needs more than ~8 steps, suggest splitting it into smaller refactors.

Wait for user confirmation before proceeding. A refactor without buy-in leads to rejected PRs.

## Step 4: Execute

For each step in the plan:

1. **Make the change.** Match existing codebase patterns — don't introduce new conventions during a refactor.
2. **Run tests after each step.** If tests fail, fix the regression before moving on. If you can't fix it, revert the step and tell the user.
3. **Update imports and callers.** Refactors often break references — check all usages of anything you renamed, moved, or deleted, including re-exports and string references in configs and tests.

## Step 5: Verify

1. **Run the full test suite.** Compare against the baseline:
   - All previously passing tests must still pass.
   - No new failures introduced.
2. **Run linting and type-checking** if applicable.
3. **Spot-check behavior** — if the refactored code has a UI or CLI surface, verify it still works the same way.
4. **Confirm it was worth it.** Compare before and after: is there less to read or hold in your head to follow this code? If not, revert that part and say so in the summary.

## Step 6: Summarize

> **Refactor complete: [short title]**
>
> **What changed:**
> - [list of structural changes]
>
> **Files affected:** [list]
>
> **Tests:** [baseline] → [after] (no regressions)
>
> **Follow-up:** [anything the user should know — e.g., "callers in X still use the old pattern, consider updating those separately"]

## Principles

- **Behavior stays the same.** If the user wants to change behavior AND refactor, do them separately — refactor first, then change behavior. Mixing the two makes bugs impossible to attribute.
- **Don't over-refactor.** Stop when the code is clear and maintainable. Chasing "perfect" structure creates churn with diminishing returns. If the user asked to extract a helper, extract the helper — don't also reorganize the entire module.
